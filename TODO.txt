* Use sklearn 0.18.1 or later

* Use min_samples_leaf parameter instead of dept and use float for percentage of samples

* Write some code that optimizes alpha for gaussian processes
* Show confidence interval for guassian processes
* Do forecasting cross-validation the proper way
* Include random forest regressor in forecasting

* Investigate how to deal with large datasets (possibly using Oger code for large datasets)
